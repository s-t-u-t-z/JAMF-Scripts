(Policy 2) - App Removal Policy (uninstall package)




<h3>There are two version of this script one for a normal Policy that can be ran during a patching window.  
The other is a Self Service policy that can be ran anytime.</h3><br>

<b>(1) RUM Log (/var/tmp):</b><br>
The RUM (Remote Update Manager) command is used to determine what updates are available.  The script will create a log
file and dump its contents to it.<br><br>

<b>(2) User is prompted informing of available updates:</b><br>
Using the JAMF Helper window the script will pick out the available updates in the RUM log and clean up the wording.<br><br>

<b>(3) Window will appear during the downloading/install of the update:</b><br>
While the update is downloading and installing the JAMF Helper window will stay open.  Once the update has completed it will
close.<br><br>

<b>(4.0) Confirmation window (Updates Completed):</b><br>
A confirmation window will appear once all updates are completed.<br><br>

<b>(4.1) Confirmation window (No Updates):</b><br>
If there are no Adobe updates available the user will see this window.<br><br>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
--  To make the JAMF Helper window look more presentable to the user, package up all the Adobe icons and add them to the policy.  That way during the download/install process it displays the app icon of the update that is currently being installed.  See the script for more information.<br><br>
--  If using the Policy version of the script the user will only be prompted with windows if there are updates available.  The user will have to click "Install" in order to start the update process but they will not be given the option to "cancel".<br><br>
--  If using the Self Service version the user will be allowed to "cancel" the update process.
